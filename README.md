# flexbox
Learning Flexbox with FreeCodeCamp, making a Photo Gallery. 


Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:

row (default): horizontal axis with flex items from left to right <br>
row-reverse: horizontal axis with flex items from right to left <br>
column: vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom <br>
column-reverse: vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top <br>
Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction. <br>
