# flexbox
Learning Flexbox with FreeCodeCamp, making a Photo Gallery. 


Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:

<strong>row (default):</strong> horizontal axis with flex items from left to right <br>
<strong>row-reverse:</strong> horizontal axis with flex items from right to left <br>
<strong>column:</strong> vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom <br>
<strong>column-reverse:</strong> vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top <br>
<strong>Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction.</strong> <br>
